&lt;p>This document describes a Janelia Workstation deployment intended for setting up a personal development environment. Unlike the canonical distributed deployments which use Docker Swarm, this deployment uses Docker Compose to orchestrate the services on a single server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that this deployment does not build and serve the Workstation client installers, although that could certainly be added in cases where those pieces need to be developed and tested. In most cases, however, it is expected that this server-side deployment be paired with a development client built and run directly from IntelliJ or NetBeans.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contribution guidelines</title><link>https://hortacloud.janelia.org/docs/development/contributing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hortacloud.janelia.org/docs/development/contributing/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
