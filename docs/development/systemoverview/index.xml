Asynchronous vs synchronous saving The final persistence store for Horta is in MongoDB, a document database, whether or not the data being saved is asynchronous or synchronous. Most Horta data is saved synchronously; the purpose of the asynchronous saving is to:
Ease the burden on the annotator to constantly save their work Share annotations in realtime with other annotators or machine algorithms working in the same workspace Persistence flow All access to MongoDB is wrapped by a RESTful API, jacs-sync, with a number of endpoints for CRUD operations for TmWorkspace, TmSample, and TmNeuronMetadata.</description></item><item><title>Tiled Imagery</title><link>https://hortacloud.janelia.org/docs/development/systemoverview/tileimagery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hortacloud.janelia.org/docs/development/systemoverview/tileimagery/</guid><description>Horta 2D Horta&amp;rsquo;s 2D and 3D viewer were originally 2 separate visualization packages, so the way that they load tile imagery is quite different. Horta2D was called LVV (Large Volume Viewer) and exclusively loads many 2D slices from a TIFF Octree at a specific resolution to produce a mosaic that fills the window. These 2D slices are retrieved from the jacs-sync REST API based off the current focus on the window.</description></item><item><title>Event Handling/Communication</title><link>https://hortacloud.janelia.org/docs/development/systemoverview/eventhandling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hortacloud.janelia.org/docs/development/systemoverview/eventhandling/</guid><description>This section briefly covers how information is shared throughout the GUI in Horta
EventBus To preserve code independence between different modules in Horta, an EventBus from Google is used. This acts likes an internal publish/subscribe framework within the client, allowing methods to listen for certain events to happen. Events are sent asynchronously on the EventBus, so they are managed in a separate thread than the main AWT thread.
In Horta, the EventBus is mainly used to communicate events that concern multiple GUI components.</description></item></channel></rss>
