  How is HortaCloud supported?
---

Janelia Scientific Computing supports HortaCloud as part of our [Open Science Software Initiative](https://ossi.janelia.org/). As part of the HortaCloud Community Project, we aim to:
* Maintain the code base to ensure long-term stability and usability.
* Serve as the open-source project lead for coordinating and integrating code contributions.
* Create and release new versions of the software as appropriate.
* Receive feedback through direct communication and GitHub Issues, which we try to address as soon as possible. However, we are limited by the amount of funding available through the Open Science Software Initiative as well as potential internal projects with higher priority.
* Host periodic community meetings to discuss user experiences and development updates.
* Provide guidance and advice to users and developers working with HortaCloud.
* Continue to update the documentation as questions are addressed.

To ensure sustainable support and foster a collaborative community, there are certain types of assistance we are not able to provide. 
* Guaranteed support within a certain time frame or on-call availability.
* Hands-on changes or troubleshooting directly within users’ environments.
    * We may provide guidance, but are not able to carry out direct operations on user systems.
    * Suggestions will be provided as GitHub Gists so that they are reusable and can be referenced later. 
* Implementation of new features is generally limited to those that align with Janelia’s priorities. 
    * However, we very much welcome community contributions and are happy to provide guidance for externally driven feature development.

These boundaries help us focus on maintaining a robust, open, and community-driven platform while managing the limited resources of our development team.
