  What is HortaCloud?
---
HortaCloud is a streaming 3D annotation platform for large microscopy data that runs entirely in the cloud. It is a free, open source research software tool, developed by Janelia Research Campus.

It combines state-of-the-art volumetric visualization, advanced features for 3D neuronal annotation, and real-time multi-user collaboration with a set of enterprise-grade backend microservices for moving and processing large amounts of data rapidly and securely. HortaCloud takes advantage of cloud-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to perform all 3D rendering in cloud-leased GPUs which are data-adjacent, and only transfer a high-fidelity interactive video stream to each annotatorâ€™s local compute platform through a web browser.

* **What is it good for?**: HortaCloud is a powerful tool for 3D visualization and annotation of large-scale microscopy data. It has been used to trace axons across the entire mouse brain by Janelia's [MouseLight Team Project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/mouselight).

* **What is it not good for?**: HortaCloud is a very specialized tool for sparse microscopy data. It is not intended for annotation of dense data sets, such as electron microscopy (EM) imagery.

* **What makes HortaCloud unique?**: Leveraging state-of-the-art services on AWS allows HortaCloud to run entirely in the cloud, making it possible to visualize terabyte-scale 3D volumes without moving all of that data over the Internet (see diagram below).

## Where should I go next?

If you are a HortaCloud user, read through the [User Manual](/docs/user_manual) to get familiar with the tools.

If you are a system administrator or developer looking to deploy an instance of HortaCloud, start with the [AWS Deployment Guide](/docs/administration/aws).
