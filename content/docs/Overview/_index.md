  What is HortaCloud?
---

HortaCloud is a streaming 3D annotation platform for large microscopy data that runs entirely in the cloud. It is based on the Janelia Workstation software and was originally developed in support of the MouseLight Team Project.

It combines state-of-the-art volumetric visualization, advanced features for 3D neuronal annotation, and real-time multi-user collaboration with a set of enterprise-grade backend microservices for moving and processing large amounts of data rapidly and securely. HortaCloud takes advantage of cloud-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to perform all 3D rendering in cloud-leased GPUs which are data-adjacent, and only transfer a high-fidelity interactive video stream to each annotatorâ€™s local compute platform through a web browser.

The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).

Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

## What is it?

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:

* **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?

* **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.

## Where should I go next?

If you are a HortaCloud user, read through the [User Manual](/docs/UserManual) to get familiar with the tools.

If you are a system administrator or developer looking to deploy an instance of HortaCloud, read the [Deployment Guide](/docs/Administration/Deployment).

* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!
