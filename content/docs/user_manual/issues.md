    How to report issues with HortaCloud
---

If you encounter an issue while running Horta, or if you have comments, questions, or suggestions, there are multiple ways you can contact the Horta development team.

## Inside Horta

(desktop) You may report a bug at any time within Horta. Simply choose "Report a bug" from the Help menu. Provide a description of what you were doing at the time of the issue! Sometimes Horta will encounter problems and display a dialog box with an ugly-looking error message. At the bottom of this dialog box, you'll also see a "Report" button. Again, please let us know what you were doing at the time of the issue if you choose to report an issue at this time.

This feature does not currently work in HortaCloud! The dialog works, but email is not sent!
