    How to report issues with HortaCloud
---

If you encounter an issue while running Horta, or if you have comments, questions, or suggestions, there are multiple ways you can contact the Horta development team.


## Inside Horta

(desktop) You may report a bug at any time within Horta. Simply choose "Report a bug" from the Help menu. Provide a description of what you were doing at the time of the issue! Sometimes Horta will encounter problems and display a dialog box with an ugly-looking error message. At the bottom of this dialog box, you'll also see a "Report" button. Again, please let us know what you were doing at the time of the issue if you choose to report an issue at this time.

This feature does not currently work in HortaCloud! The dialog works, but email is not sent!

## GitHub

GitHub is where the HortaCloud and Janelia Workstation source code is stored. If you are a GitHub user and would like to open an issue:

- the Janelia Workstation repository: https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/workstation
    + this repo contains the code for the Horta application; if you have issues inside the application, this is the place to report them
- the HortaCloud repository: https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/hortacloud
    + this repository contains the code for managing the AWS infrastructure that deploys and runs Horta in AppStream; if you are a system admin and have deployment or management issues, report them here
